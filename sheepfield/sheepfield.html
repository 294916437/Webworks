            <h4>Rambouillet Sheep</h4>
            <p>This is a specific breed of Merino sheep.
                However, it is widespread. 
                It is probably one of the most common commercial sheep out there.
                For this reason, it deserves its own category. 
                It is the Merino sheep on steroids when it comes to popularity. 
                Practically every sheep you see in the states is likely to be a Rambouillet sheep.

                You can almost instantly tell if a sheep is a Suffolk sheep based on the coloration on its head and legs.

            <h4>Icelandic Sheep</h4>
            <p>The Icelandic sheep comes from Iceland, as you might guess. 
                It is a heritage breed that isn’t popular.
                 However, it is gaining in numbers as farmers move back towards heritage breeds. 
                 They are not as calm and tame as some other breeds.
                  However,they can be raised for fiber, meat, and milk.
                They’re very versatile and hardy.
